# Compiler Design
Compiler is a software which converts a program written in high level language (Source Language) to low level language (Object/Target/Machine Language) <br/>
Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. Compiler design covers basic translation mechanism and error detection & recovery. It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis as front end, and code generation and optimization as back-end <br/>
In this repo I have uploaded the programs which are in our curriculum.
